### Compiling Fortran programs

Simple examples from the <a href="http://ftp.g95.org/G95Manual.pdf" target="_blank">manual</a>:  
`gfortran -c hello.f90` compiles `hello.f90` to an object ﬁle named `hello.o`.  
`gfortran hello.f90` compiles `hello.f90` and links it to produce an executable `a.out` (on Linux), or `a.exe` (on MS Windows systems).  
`gfortran -c h1.f90 h2.f90 h3.f90` compiles multiple source ﬁles. If all goes well, object ﬁles `h1.o`, `h2.o` and `h3.o` are created.  
`gfortran -o hello h1.f90 h2.f90 h3.f90` compiles multiple source ﬁles and links them together to an executable ﬁle named `hello` on Linux, or `hello.exe` on MS Windows systems.

These are some Fortran programs that I wrote when I was a PhD student or a while after my graduation. I wrote many of them just for fun :)
